## Challenges
- This entire project required the team to implement new technologies for the first time, and we felt the learning curve for the first week. After getting a handle on React and utilizing conditional rendering for the various component displays, we refactored the site using Router to replace the conditional rendering of components. After finalizing our displays and UI, we implemented Cypress, which was initially a challenge to implement effectively, but after some deeper research the team was proud to be able to create a robust testing suite. 
- Because the data used for this project was fetched from an API, some information was missing for certain movies. The team had to utilize conditional rendering for the data to account for instances of missing data points. 

## Wins
- learning & implementing several new technologies within the two week duration of this project
- taking the time to fully understand and grasp concepts
- teamwork
- communication

## Technologies Used
1. React
2. React Router
3. Cypress

## Future Iterations
- Additional search functionality by genre
- Trailer carousel
